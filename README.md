####################### Beginning of the journal 13rd of Octorber 2023 #######################

13/10/23 -> Started studying DevOps directly, the goal now is to get a broad idea of the enviroment and how I will aproach this first basic contact.

15/10/23 -> Started a new course, more focused on DevOps (53h Imran Teli), the biggest reason to change direction was the necessity of acquiring better understanding of the devops basics [I MUST FINISH THIS ONE!!]

17/10/23 -> So many bugs with vagrant (local virtualization), though Im starting to feel the very first signs of understanding Devops culture and automation, quite subtle though.

21/10/23 -> finished the first part of the Devops course, it was about the basis of the workload, lots of traditional virtualization, linux, bash (missed on more networking but I already done a small youtube course on it, 20 or so hours on it).

22/10/23 -> Learning how to include AWS into the mix, replacing on-premise "servers" and even other services with cloud power. Great feeling to be reaching this point to finally make the connection between the cloud and devops practices. (Before this course I was studying only cloud without any real understanding of operations/linux/network)

23/10/23 -> Starting the Jenkins section of the course, it is the longes section of the whole course (6h), Imran does not fuck around, he is a straigh shooter and those 6 hours are of pure content and knowledge, this will be specially a wild ride since I was really looking forward to learn Jenkins cause there is something I like about automation and it looks like Jenkins would be the first actual taste of it.

24/10/23 -> 2 days of intense CI/CD studies, it was actually my first formal contact with the concept(I had heard of it, but never actually had my hands on it), the tool Imran chooses is Jenkins ( I am aware there are many other options available ).
I am still half way through the CI/CD section and I did face a bit of a learning curve in order to get the bigger picture, a few particular new concepts were quite challenging to fully comprehend, but the little I could grasp was very exciting and motivating.

25/10/23 -> Done with first half of the studying section (Jenkins), and with taht finished

26/10/23 -> Due to some burnout from the Jenkins section, I ended up spending the day halfassing, I had the material out but ended up just trying to solve some bugs I had with jenkins+ECS (aws) and a generalized SSH issue. It was basically a day off. no focus and no discipline.

27/10/23 -> Infelizmente comecei o dia colocando umas horas mas logo me abati e procurei reorganizar meu schedule pois Manu esta querendo comecar um trabalho novo.
Horarios bem mais estritos e agora todo dia preciso definir o que vai ser estudado no dia seguinte!

[[28/10/23]]

Objetives:

1. Do a revision of the jenkins section
2. Fix bug that prevented the ECS/jenkins work
3. finish Jenkins section

I could get a lot of study in, but a bit unfocused, it was guided at a high level by the Jenkins material but ended up going everywhere around the subject.

**[[  29/10/23  ]]**

Planning: Finish revision (Docker part specially)
Execution: Done! And even better, could fix the bug with ECS/Jenkins as well!
The revision overall was very beneficial, I went over the jenkins section too quickly and now Im glad I got so many bugs in the section project, that forced me to go back and redo most of the section and I actually expanded the research a lil bit.

**[[  30/10/23  ]]**

Planning: Finish Jenkins section.
Execution: took me a while to go over Jenkins using master and slave concepts, but once I did understand it was very revealing, the power of jenkins is really impressive.
Also there was one very good section on security with Jenkins, many good options but I liked role based permissions for overall utilization.

This ends Jenkins area, hell of a ride, now I do feel like I got a decent understand of the basics of what it's done in a CI enviroment, prob I will have to learn another tool like github actions, but Jenkins really spoke to me in a way, its ungly, clunky and complicated but so versatile and powerfull, the security of jenkins may be the only deal breaker at this point, it does concern me a bit how we have to leave on the server few hardcoded stuff .

**[[  31/10/23  ]]**
Planning: Finish Jenkins section.
