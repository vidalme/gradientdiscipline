# diario de bordo

Apos quase 20 anos, volto para tech.

**[[01/01/23]]** -> pesquisa sobre programacao

07/01/23 -> python

14/01/23 -> comecei a focar em frontend, html+css+js

01/02/23 -> total foco em JS, intermediary to advanced

20/02/23 -> react and other frontend stuff (tailwind, git, libs)

15/04/23 -> typescript

05/05/23 -> ultimo commit git, dei um tempo...

############################ O RE-retorno ########################################

Apos quase 4 meses afastado do retorno, aqui vem o re-retorno, em nova modalidade, ouvi falar
dessa tal de cloud e devops.
FIquei curioso e vou comeÃ§ar a pesquisar do que se trata pois nem sei realmente o que faz direito.
Passar uns dias tentando entender esse novo universo.

##############################################################################################
##############################################################################################

23/08/23 -> pesquisa sobre devops, cloud, certificados... (yt)

26/08/23 -> brief intro linux/bash (yt)

29/08/23 -> brief intro network (yt)

01/09/23 -> brief intro cloud/aws (yt)

07/09/23 -> brief intro devops (automation, docker, kubernetes) (yt)

13/09/23 -> foco no certificado SAA aws (deadline 13/12/23) (skillbuilder, aws whitepapers, yt and a bit of udemy)

12/10/23 -> cantrill no reddit me deu o toque de ir mais devagar com aws e abrir mais o leque por enquanto.

13/10/23 -> Started studying DevOps directly, the goal now is to get a broad idea of the enviroment and how I will aproach this first basic contact.

15/10/23 -> Started a new course, more focused on DevOps (53h Imran Teli), the biggest reason to change direction was the necessity of acquiring better understanding of the devops basics [I MUST FINISH THIS ONE!!]

17/10/23 -> So many bugs with vagrant (local virtualization), though Im starting to feel the very first signs of understanding Devops culture and automation, quite subtle though.

21/10/23 -> finished the first part of the Devops course, it was about the basis of the workload, lots of traditional virtualization, linux, bash (missed on more networking but I already done a small youtube course on it, 20 or so hours on it).

22/10/23 -> Learning how to include AWS into the mix, replacing on-premise "servers" and even other services with cloud power. Great feeling to be reaching this point to finally make the connection between the cloud and devops practices. (Before this course I was studying only cloud without any real understanding of operations/linux/network)

23/10/23 -> Starting the Jenkins section of the course, it is the longes section of the whole course (6h), Imran does not fuck around, he is a straigh shooter and those 6 hours are of pure content and knowledge, this will be specially a wild ride since I was really looking forward to learn Jenkins cause there is something I like about automation and it looks like Jenkins would be the first actual taste of it.

24/10/23 -> 2 days of intense CI/CD studies, it was actually my first formal contact with the concept(I had heard of it, but never actually had my hands on it), the tool Imran chooses is Jenkins ( I am aware there are many other options available ).
I am still half way through the CI/CD section and I did face a bit of a learning curve in order to get the bigger picture, a few particular new concepts were quite challenging to fully comprehend, but the little I could grasp was very exciting and motivating.

25/10/23 -> Done with first half of the studying section (Jenkins), and with taht finished

26/10/23 -> Due to some burnout from the Jenkins section, I ended up spending the day halfassing, I had the material out but ended up just trying to solve some bugs I had with jenkins+ECS (aws) and a generalized SSH issue. It was basically a day off. no focus and no discipline.

27/10/23 -> Infelizmente comecei o dia colocando umas horas mas logo me abati e procurei reorganizar meu schedule pois Manu esta querendo comecar um trabalho novo.
Horarios bem mais estritos e agora todo dia preciso definir o que vai ser estudado no dia seguinte!

[[28/10/23]]

Objetives:

1. Do a revision of the jenkins section
2. Fix bug that prevented the ECS/jenkins work
3. finish Jenkins section

I could get a lot of study in, but a bit unfocused, it was guided at a high level by the Jenkins material but ended up going everywhere around the subject.

**[[29/10/23]]**

Planning: Finish revision (Docker part specially)
Execution: Done! And even better, could fix the bug with ECS/Jenkins as well!
The revision overall was very beneficial, I went over the jenkins section too quickly and now Im glad I got so many bugs in the section project, that forced me to go back and redo most of the section and I actually expanded the research a lil bit.

**[[30/10/23]]**

Planning: Finish Jenkins section.
Execution: took me a while to go over Jenkins using master and slave concepts, but once I did understand it was very revealing, the power of jenkins is really impressive.
Also there was one very good section on security with Jenkins, many good options but I liked role based permissions for overall utilization.

This ends the Jenkins section, hell of a ride, now I do feel like I got a decent understand of the basics of what it's done in a CI enviroment, prob I will have to learn another tool like github actions, but Jenkins really spoke to me in a way, its ungly, clunky and complicated but so versatile and powerfull, the security of jenkins may be the only deal breaker at this point, it does concern me a bit how we have to leave on the server few hardcoded stuff .

**[[31/10/23]]**<br>
Planning: Research about Ansible, get my feet wet. <br>
Execution: I did some the research but it was quick, and I ended up following the course pre-estabilished order and I will be doing the Python part (I was a bot reclunctant on spending the time on it at this point). Very simple language and alreayd went through half of it.<br><br>

## November

<img src="./imgs/november_studyplan.png" alt="november's studyplan" />

**[[01/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Finish videos from Python section, maybe write some practice code (related to devops/automation) <br>
Execution:

Comments
I ended up finishing the python section but didnt really practice it, it was quite a quick intro to python and I will be seeing it again in the future. So what I really spent my day on was Ansible, boy am I sold on it. I did watch some lectures but I was leaned more on free research, jsut to get an overall grasp of the tool and what it solves.

<br><br>

**[[02/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Go hard at Ansible <br>
Execution: oh boy I did, very much so!

Comments
Followed a lot of video lectures and some decent ammount of documentation reading, not a lot of practice though. I am a bit tired and got a bit ahead of myself, so I guess before finishing the last hour of the ansible section I will take some time off to watch a few "related" videos. I am feeling like following someones project and maybe trying to get a very small project myself would be very beneficial at this point. I am ahead of schedule and do have the available time for it, I just need to make sure this side quest includes Ansible.

<br><br>

**[[03/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Take it easy and check some related material/projects with ansible <br>
Execution: Wander a lot around the devops world then smashed ansible section.

Comments
A bit of checking devops videos, more related to concepts and culturem this was fun but not really practical, I guess it does help with getting confortable with some tech terms.
Then I tried to watch a few "projects tutorials" but I had a difficult time from the get got, since they all did something with Docker / Terraform within the first 5 minutes. Techs I havent really understood fully.
After feeling like I waste a lot of time I went back to the course and finished the rest of Ansible section, even though it was for only 2 days, I actually took a lot of new concepts even a quick glace (20 mins class) at IaC in the cloud using aws, seems like Terraform is the actual current tool for provisioning infra in the cloud, Ansible is still good tho for configuring all the infra, so I should see a lot of Ansible in my future.

<br><br>

**[[04/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: AWS networking concepts <br>
Execution: I could get a lot done, focused on the actual aws networking concepts, missed the last class that will be done next day

Comments: I could focus but I had a famili commitment in te evening, so my studies ended abruptly at around 16:00. I was actually really tired for not being able to sleep well the past feew days so I guess this break will be fruitfull, I already feel better today (sunday).
The study was difficult but a bit frustrating since it was all unexpectadly review of AWS material, for some reason I expected to be something more integrated with devops fuctionality, but I guess the next section will be aws and pipeline using aws services I havent touched yet, but it is a short section.

<br><br>

**[[05/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Finish AWS networking review, finish as well next section, which goes over a AWS CI/CD services <br>

Execution: I didnt really focus tahta much, but I got at least 3 good ours in.

Comments: I could not finish teh left overs of the ci/cd aws section, bit cause I am very tired of the subject (dying to go into docker next) and a bit of the quality of the course, it really fell a lot. Lots of mistakes by Imran during the lectures but I also just didnt feel like doing it, so I basically quit halfway through second last lecture of the section, I may actually try different tutors/tutorials for this subject which will def be necessary for devops carreer (although I guess docker will be so much more relevant)

Im 75% into Imrans course so far and now I feel like I can take a break of his lectures a bit, I will keep on the same path and will take a equivalent Docker course on youtube. It's a very recent tutorial and it seems by the comments that people liked it, its 5 hours long which is basically as long as imrans one.

<br><br>

**[[06/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: I will try a new tutor for docker, english without an accent for a bit and he seems to tell a lot of the whys before the hows approach.
I plan on finishing it in about 3 days at the longest.

<br>

Execution: I went 1 hour into the yt video, did not like it, then went back to Imran's and took it really slow

Comments: Slowly I am feeling a need of learning more about linux and network, the gap of knowledge really slows me down on the learning path.
So today after re starting doing Imrans Docker section, i felt that Imrans course is quite outdated in the last few sections, specially Docker, even teaching stuff that people jsut dont use it anymore.
I tried to expand my studies into linux stuff (specifically awk command), I guess I should take a bit more of a holistic path and try to be less tunnel vision cause devops really isnt about a single tech, so I need those strong basis.

<br><br>

**[[07/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Focus on linux, I will try to close some gaps at least in linux (following the recommended minimal from roadmap.sh)
<br>

Execution: Done very well, followed the EDx ICPA I course, with focus on processes, filesystem and a bit of shell scripting.

Comments: Edx was a bit boring but I got better understanding of process and file system, trained a bit of scripting as well. I was really tired today due to not skeeping last night but I could get stuff done and put the timein. I do feel like I absorbed a lot even tired (sign that my brain is just gettin more fortitude) of the important underlying cooncepts of linux. I really need to get good at this, it will reflect on most of my career as a IT solver.

<br><br>

**[[08/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: More linux, I could def spend a whole day studying networking (if there is time do a few shell script tutorials or go for other linux concepts)
<br>

Execution: I went for networking early, switched to linux a lil of bash script and then commands for text/search maniulation linux.

Comments: It was really hard to go over networking, super duper boring, most of it I already knew so I jsut glaced over it, I did a bit of research into security as well, but very very brielfy, I guess I should get back to network and do some work on it, I think it really happened was that I didnt find a goot tutorial with a nice lil project to get mmy hands on it (conceptually im still confused on networking). What I really did was study linux commands.

<br><br>

**[[09/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: I think I could spend a bit more time playing with linux, really a lot to learn to even think of becoming employable, I really need to focus on learning real sysadmin skills, I am sure they will be helpfull. (maybe a bit of regEx), another good thing is that I am actually excited about learning linux, so let's just do this for a few days then make sure to finish Imrans course, next few days I could actually may go back and forth between focused linux sstudies along with Imrans course or some other topic I might be interested (as long as it is related to devsecops), try to mix up studying with different topics sessions.
<br>

Execution: Started the day trying to find a different way of learning Docker, I ended up focusing on Imrans second Docker section. I do feel a decent improvemtn in my docker knowledge.

Comments:
There is just so much of linux to learn, so I ended up taking the day to get a bit of docker in me, like I said I really think Ill be mixing things up, mostly focusing on the "ROAD" already estabilished and few interesting side quests to make things interesting (it helps alot to keep myself motivated in the short run although I regret a bit when I delay the official road too much)
Oficial road is still gettin that cloud/devsecops job IT job in a year.
up to this moment has changed but I am indeed in the middle sub-sub-mission (my shortest goal was AWS SAA in 3 months but then I had to pause a bit so I could get more overall knowledge, going over a big shallow devops course )

<br><br>

**[[10/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Move to kubernetes, focus on Imrans course.

Execution:
