<h2>Nemesis Divina Era</h2>
Apos quase 4 meses afastado do retorno, aqui vem o re-retorno, em nova modalidade, ouvi falar
dessa tal de cloud e devops.
FIquei curioso e vou começar a pesquisar do que se trata pois nem sei realmente o que faz direito.
Passar uns dias tentando entender esse novo universo.

<h2>ONE YEAR TO GET JOB READY ON THE CLOUD </h2>
<h3>Beginning of the journal 13th of Octorber 2023</h3>
<b>13/10/2023</b><br>
Started studying DevOps directly, the goal now is to get a broad idea of the enviroment and how I will aproach this first basic contact.<br><br>
<b>15/10/2023</b><br>
Started a new course, more focused on DevOps (53h Imran Teli), the biggest reason to change direction was the necessity of acquiring better understanding of the devops basics [I MUST FINISH THIS ONE!!]<br><br>
<b>17/10/23</b> many bugs with vagrant (local virtualization), though Im starting to feel the very first signs of understanding Devops culture and automation, quite subtle though.<br><br>
<b>21/10/23</b><br>
finished the first part of the Devops course, it was about the basis of the workload, lots of traditional virtualization, linux, bash (missed on more networking but I already done a small youtube course on it, 20 or so hours on it).<br><br>
<b>22/10/23</b><br>
Learning how to include AWS into the mix, replacing on-premise "servers" and even other services with cloud power. Great feeling to be reaching this point to finally make the connection between the cloud and devops practices. (Before this course I was studying only cloud without any real understanding of operations/linux/network)<br><br>
<b>23/10/23</b><br>
<p>Starting the Jenkins section of the course, it is the longest section of the whole course (6h), Imran does not fuck around, he is a straigh shooter and those 6 hours are of pure content and knowledge. 
<p>I expect this to be specially a wild ride since I was really looking forward to learn Jenkins cause there is something I like about automation and it looks like Jenkins would be the first actual taste of it.<br><br>
<b>24/10/23</b><br>
2 days of intense CI/CD studies, it was actually my first formal contact with the concept(I had heard of it, but never actually had my hands on it), the tool Imran chooses is Jenkins ( I am aware there are many other options available ).<br>
I am still half way through the CI/CD section and I did face a bit of a learning curve in order to get the bigger picture, a few particular new concepts were quite challenging to fully comprehend, but the little I could grasp was very exciting and motivating.<br><br>
<b>25/10/23</b><br>
Done with first half of the studying section (Jenkins), and with taht finished<br><br>
<b>26/10/23</b><br>Due to some burnout from the Jenkins section, I ended up spending the day halfassing, I had the material out but ended up just trying to solve some bugs I had with jenkins+ECS (aws) and a generalized SSH issue. It was basically a day off. no focus and no discipline.<br><br>
<b>27/10/23</b><br>Infelizmente comecei o dia colocando umas horas mas logo me abati e procurei reorganizar meu schedule pois Manu esta querendo comecar um trabalho novo.<br>
Horarios bem mais estritos e agora todo dia preciso definir o que vai ser estudado no dia seguinte!<br><br>
<hr>
<h3>28/10/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<ol>
<li>Do a revision of the jenkins section</li>
<li>Fix bug that prevented the ECS/jenkins work</li>
<li>Finish Jenkins section</li>
</ol>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I managed to study quite a bit, but it was somewhat unfocused. The Jenkins material provided a high-level guide, but I ended up exploring various aspects of the subject.

<hr>
<h3>29/10/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish revision (Docker part specially)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Done! And even better, could fix the bug with ECS/Jenkins as well!
The revision overall was very beneficial, I went over the jenkins section too quickly and now Im glad I got so many bugs in the section project, that forced me to go back and redo most of the section and I actually expanded the research a lil bit.

<hr>
<h3>30/10/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish Jenkins section.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
took me a while to go over Jenkins using master and slave concepts, but once I did understand it was very revealing, the power of jenkins is really impressive.
Also there was one very good section on security with Jenkins, many good options but I liked role based permissions for overall utilization.

This ends the Jenkins section, hell of a ride, now I do feel like I got a decent understand of the basics of what it's done in a CI enviroment, prob I will have to learn another tool like github actions, but Jenkins really spoke to me, its fugly, clunky and complicated but so versatile and powerfull, the lack of security in jenkins may be the only deal breaker at this point, it does concern me a bit how we have to leave on the server hardcoded stuff.

<hr>
<h3>31/10/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Research about Ansible, get my feet wet.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did some the research but it was quick, and I ended up following the course pre-estabilished order and I will be doing the Python part (I was a bit reclunctant on spending the time on it at this point). Very simple language and alreayd went through half of it.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>November 2024</h2>

<h3>01/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish videos from Python section, maybe write some practice code (related to devops/automation)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I ended up finishing the python section but didnt really practice it, it was quite a quick intro to python and I will be seeing it again in the future. So what I really spent my day on was Ansible, boy am I sold on it. I did watch some lectures but I was leaned more on free research, jsut to get an overall grasp of the tool and what it solves.
<hr>
<h3>02/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Go hard at Ansible
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Followed a lot of video lectures and some decent ammount of documentation reading, not a lot of practice though. I am a bit tired and got a bit ahead of myself, so I guess before finishing the last hour of the ansible section I will take some time off to watch a few "related" videos. I am feeling like following someones project and maybe trying to get a very small project myself would be very beneficial at this point. I am ahead of schedule and do have the available time for it, I just need to make sure this side quest includes Ansible.
<hr>
<h3>03/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Take it easy and check some related material/projects with ansible
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Wander a lot around the devops world then smashed ansible section.<br>
A bit of checking devops videos, more related to concepts and culturem this was fun but not really practical, I guess it does help with getting confortable with some tech terms.
Then I tried to watch a few "projects tutorials" but I had a difficult time from the get got, since they all did something with Docker / Terraform within the first 5 minutes. Techs I havent really understood fully.
After feeling like I waste a lot of time I went back to the course and finished the rest of Ansible section, even though it was for only 2 days, I actually took a lot of new concepts even a quick glace (20 mins class) at IaC in the cloud using aws, seems like Terraform is the actual current tool for provisioning infra in the cloud, Ansible is still good tho for configuring all the infra, so I should see a lot of Ansible in my future.
<hr>
<h3>04/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
AWS networking concepts
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
A lot of repeated content, I thought it would be something different. Plew throught it though.
<hr>
<h3>05/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish AWS networking review, finish as well next section, which goes over a AWS CI/CD services 
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Weak day, only 3 hours. Really tired of CI/CD and AWS (I need switching to keep interested, that was the reason to learn devops hehe)
<hr>
<h3>06/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker (maybe try a different angle)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I tried a diffenret tutor and hated it, got real confused with Docker, this is real new territory.
<hr>
<h3>07/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Linux (from roadmap.sh)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
A lot of reading about Linux concepts, specially about processes and storage.
<hr>
<h3>08/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Linux and shell scripting
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
actual shell scripting hands on, lots of documentation reading
<hr>
<h3>09/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker / Linux
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Could actually do a lot of the course, it was clarifyin and I feel some improvement in Docker understanding.
<hr>
<h3>10/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
kubernetes
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
did nothing, HUGE L in the day, woke up real late and just couldnt study at all. Just a very tiny bit of Docker revision.
<hr>
<h3>11/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I got a lot done, full docker focus, read a lot of docs as well (did the whoel gettin started from the official docs). I still feel like I need more practice on docker, I really want to get this down so it smooths out the kubernetes transition.
<hr>
<h3>12/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker (maybe kubernetes)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Got a bit of Docker in, not much tho, enough to complete the 60 weekly hour goal for the first time.
<hr>
<h3>13/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker (maybe swarm/k8s) or focus on kodekloud new platform (cause its free for now, so I really should enjoy for now)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Turns out the platform wasn't free, so I just dug my head into kubernetes really, Imrans course bugged out so I started following kodeklouds youtube free kubernetes course/labs.
<hr>
<h3>14/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Kubernetes (kodekloud)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
went hard on kubernetes, trying to build a good base, not taking any shortcuts on it, Ill study trying to build stuff along with every new concept, will need a lot of practice in the beginning to make at least the base super clearly understood.
<hr>
<h3>15/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
kubernetes (chill a bit), try different sources and a high level understanding.
<br>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Checked a few channles ended up gettin back to Imrans course, I MUST FINISH IT!!(after finishing I already have 10 following plans, but just focus on the course, the gola was just to have a better understanding of devops, not getting good at it right now) I also got a few issues re-installing kOps to create k8s clusters, I need to work on my patience when facing bugs. Anyways, went back later solved it and could get few good hours in.
<hr>
<h3>16/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
kubernetes
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Not very effient honestly, facing a lot of bugs with kops for creating and managing clusters. The actual Imrans course I accomplished only a single 15 minutes class. My understanding of kubernetes is coming up for sure but very veyr very slowly... I may be too eager, not even a week of kubernetes.
<hr>
<h3>17/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Kubernetes (Imrans course + hands on)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Docker and kubernetes!
Well, changed completelly the day, but I think it was fruitfull. I did a long review on Docker, even dockerized an old react app of mine. I really feel like I needed that to help me with kubernetes, even though I was doing some low level Docker stuff the help comes as a better high level of the whole cycle with docker and kubernetes. So it was good practice and it may be the beggining of a full project that I need to do by the end of Imrans course, I will need to get this app react repo with a ci/cd with infra from terraform and ansible, then dockerizing it and throwing into a kubernetes cluster.
<hr>
<h3>18/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Kubernetes (Imrans course + hands on)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I completed a few more lectures of kubernetes, but I keep coming back to older lectures, making sure I get a good basis, so Ive been doiing a lot of practicing extra research, basically for every 1 hour of lecture it takes 20 more hours of research and practice. I will end the kubernetes section with a decent understanding of the very basics because I do pretend to build a lot more on top of it.
<hr>
<h3>19/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Kubernetes (Imrans course + hands on)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Kept on trying to make k8s services run after midnigth. During the day I spent with family, I was only one hour from my weekly objecive and at night I completed the hour with some research on k8s network.
<hr>
<h3>20/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Kubernetes (Imrans course + hands on) - doing what i missed from yesterday.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
didnt put that much time in and I am still lcoked up trying to run my app in kubernetes, so I went back into docker to fix the image, so right now Im basically getting practice with docker and kubernetes, actual hands on.
<hr>
<h3>21/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
docker + kubernetes hands on practice.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Completed a week on k8s so I sprinted a bit to complete it. Got deep into k8s but not with complete understanding, I went a bit through the motions on the k8s project, i just dont feel like I have enough k8s knowledge yet. This def must be reviewed for at least another week. K8s is done and I already initiated 2 new sections, terraform and gitops.
<hr>
<h3>22/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Terraform (prefereably finish it in 2 days, I only need a overview for now)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Well I finished it in a single day, terraform is not as simple, there is a lot of "coding" in it. I could understand most of it, almost 95% and thats why I could go through it real fast, I just think to actually get good at it I will need to put a lot of practice time in it. Although I did enjoy it and I wanted to spend more time on it right now I wont, I have to remind myself constantly that it is only a ovewview for now.
<hr>
<h3>23/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish Gitops section or at least 2 sections at most.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished gitops section and the other last two section of the course. The last 2 sections were kinda old using Jenkins (which I do not think Ill focus any energy on) and the other very last section was on aws cloudformation (IAC which people do not use directly), so I went over it real fast and I may return (specially to the GitOps section becuase it used an architecture very interesting) with terraform, kubernetes, git actions.
Finished Imrans course, I do feel I learn a lot but at the same tim I feel like I was introduced to a lot of new contents and ideas, now I need to sif through it and pick a few to get good at it.
Now there is only a month left in the year, I will organize it to try and get as much as I can in, but the content will for sure be focused on my basic tech gaps; network, linux, servers, protocols... so next year I can focus on deep diving specific techs. (k8s, cloud, terraform, helm, shell scripting/python)
I also spent a bit drawing a skill map so I can figure the areas I am lacking
<hr>
<h3>24/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Nginx Mastery youtube -> 7 hours ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlCloo47p_E&list=PLOLrQ9Pn6cawvMA5JjhzoQrnKbYGYQqx1&index=3 )
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did some decent ammount of nginx study, the tutorial I picked up to follow ended up being a lot of nginx running on docker, which grabbed a lot of my attention, so I ended up leaning towards doing docker stuff. I liked it and I think this si the way to go forward, but right now I really should focus more on more basic stuff, basics aer very important for me, I really need to be good at linux most of all
<hr>
<h3>25/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Moms bday, prob won't study at all
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
well yep, exaclty that, didn touch the computer at all... it will complete 48h without no studying, so I guess I really should go tonite...
<hr>
<h3>26/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Plan out the last few days of november and start having a skecth of what dcember will look like
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I ended up just spending the whole weekend with family, it was great but now I will need to make up for it. Next week will be 60 hours week (with focus and discipline)!
<hr>
<h3>27/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on organizing what I will actually study and make sure it is a chanlenging goal for the week.
<b>A list of a few deeper gaps at this moment.\*\*</b>
<li> databases - I know the whats, whys, hows... but I need more techinical skill, like the ability to spin up DB servers (VMs and containers) and connecting them to other services (VMs and containers). At the very least 1 DB hands on set up, but 2 would be very nice (3 is the ideal, this knowledge/experience is just that important)
suggestion: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis.
<li>SSL / TLS - don't even know exactly what it is, something to do with security, get a grasp on the higher level concepts.
<li> DNS - I knwo a bit and can pass by, but Im in nee of more direct contato with it (lil of psychological bareer), I just need a few videos to feel a bit more inside.
<li>Linux - even though I could clearly use a lot more knowledge about the whole Linux universe, I firtly should focus on the scripting part. Especially automation, here I could use a couple of actual projects as well.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I got a very brief quick review of Databases but I dropped it, I know I need the basis knowledge but I will focus on the employable skills, people need to nkow linux and shell script, its just a MUST, its basically the number one skill for jobs in SRE/Devops world. So i bought a shell script udemy course, -> Linux Shell Scripting: A Project-Based Approach to Learning Now I now I can finish a difcult course, I will try to build on it. I will do it and practice it as much as I think I should. Try to have fun with this.
<hr>
<h3>28/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Work on shell script cousrse
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I am so tired...from surf really. When there is a swell it gets very hard to put as many hours in. But I did get a good ammount, I like the subject, I am learning script but also a lot about linux administration at the same time, I actually have been feeling like I need to go deeper into linux sysadmin stuff, but I dont think it shold be focused. Also I will estabilish a crazy dead line for the rest of this course. I need to finish it quickly and maybe get a quick project of my authorship in.
<hr>
<h3>29/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Shell script udemy -> finish sections 4, 5 of shell script course
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Unfortunately I could not find myself today, just did a bad job overall, no focus and I did not follow the actual guide, tried to come up with my own rules for the final exercise of section 4. Got stuck and basically couldn't put any more value time in.
<hr>
<h3>30/11/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish section 4 and start on section 5.. Total focus and energy on doing the exercise of 5, that is the most important part of the lesson.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished both sections and even started on section 6. Today was a great day, could get a lot of time in, stayed with my daughter a good ammoutn of time as well and the time I spent studying was actually very effective.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>December 2024</h2>

<h3>01/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Draw the plan for december and finish section 6 of the shell script course.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
The plan is done but open to major modifications, I also could get a bit done for section 6 of the shellscript couse (there was a bug in the cloud that delayed me). DId not do the last exercise so it will be done tomorrow, I had already forseen this possibility.
<hr>
<h3>02/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Do section 6 exercise shellscript. (timeleft can be used to begin next sections or work o decembers plan/research)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did put a lot of work and could finish the exercise, it was over 100 lines script and Im really happy with the result even though it took me a couple of days to finish. Many hours spent on it, did revisions on the stuff also, I feel some real improvement.
<hr>
<h3>03/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Shell sctip course. Quick review of section 6 and on to at the very least finish section 7.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Kind a took the day off really, it is a sunday and my daughter is sick, kinda spet most of the time with her.
<hr>
<h3>04/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
same objective of yesterday.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Another day with short studying sessions, I wore the dad helmet all day long. I could get a few bits and pieces in but it was spread very thin along the day. Still is something tho and I do love spending the day with my baby. Tomorrow I must finish the shell course, it is delayed already.
<hr>
<h3>05/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish shellscript course. Start a 2 week linux self bootcamp, planning on follow linuxjourney.com with auxiliary videos from a devops dude focused on linux sysadmin.
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtK75qxsQaMLZSo7KL-PmiRarU7hrpnwK
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I finished the shellscript course (again finishing bad, skimming over the very last section), starting something is so easy... finishing it is the real challenge, I am glad I could finish the last 2 ones, I must be serious about this whole thing. I realy enjoy it, particularly how different and diversified the knowledge is. I did not study that much, but it was effective.
<hr>
<h3>06/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on Linux admin, the plan is to keep working on linuxjourney website. I could of course make use of side research (docs or even youtube videos)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I done pretty much what I was supposed to, not too amazing tho...in my book not goot enough, its gots to bes uhhhmazinh!
#### Planning ---> 
<hr>
<h3>07/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on focusing on linux, I do need a lot more work, at this point I need to incorpporate some networking, even tho those are 2 different fields (linux and network) they both can be worked together.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished the linuxjourney.com content and quickly extended the research and went over some DNS study (it was the last section of the linuxjourney)... I have been planning on going way deeped into DNS, in reality all I knew about it was from side quests, I never actually took the time to read into it. One and halg session later I alreadu feel like a lot of progression was made, at least at the highest level I feel like I can talkj about the subject
<hr>
<h3>08/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Dig into DNS and then learn more about linux networking (if there is time)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I got a couple of decent sessions, found out about DNSSec which i didnt know about it, it was a very complicated subject that spilled over into some securtiy/network aspects (authorization, hash, digital certificates...) so i just went down the rabbit hole. Although I wasnt as dedicated as I should be I still learned new stuff.
<hr>
<h3>09/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Today there will be a lot of social life activities, probably wont get much done, but the time I do get in I should dedicate it to Linux. (I feel like Im leanin towards some project doing, I actually may be not just ready for this but it could be in my best interest at this point)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
As I though, did not get any real technical work, I just spent the day with family and friends, attended 3 different events in the same day. There is no reason to despair tho, just keep on trucking, no need to worry about making up for it, need to live with a balance between work and family.
<hr>
<h3>10/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
The monthly plan tells me to go for linux studies, but I do think I could use a project or 2, I may just do that honestly. Since its sunday ill be a lil more lenient.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I couldnt get a lot done, actually almost nothing done, at most 1 hour of refreshing memory of jenkins.
<hr>
<h3>11/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Practice what I already studied. (aws, jenkins...)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I got a bit of actual exercise, it is a reality check, we may be able to follow very complex instructions but once wwe are left to our own that whole picture changes dramatically. Its good tho, I had to get to this crossroad someday, the sooner the better, lets get it done!
<hr>
<h3>12/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
More exercising, objective today is to get at least a simple react app up and running on a ec2 running nginx. (by myself), from there we will slowly turn up the exercise dificulty (ex: next one could be a 2 tier setup with nginx and mysql)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Amazing day, got a lot of experience and hands on job. The evolution is very slow but i can see how getting stuck can teach us a lot, I am still doing the basics of devops but I am walking with my own feet. I got a react app running on nginx installed on a EC2 virtual machine.
<hr>
<h3>13/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Investigate how i could automate the project with nginx and react.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I didnt do much, I just couldnt focus, I ended up just chilling with family.
<hr>
<h3>14/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Do the jenkins course of Nana
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I could get a bit done, but need way more, its diffcult to admit but I have been slacking, this is not a good thing, I must keep focus, I am now getting close to be employable, the certification will come, be patient and stay 100% focused.
<hr>
<h3>15/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Nana course (jenkins), no need to go too deep, but this is spaced repetition strategy, i've studied jenkins a month or so ago, now time to get some recolection and at the same time build more repos on git to show off some 'projects'
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
very productive day, feel like a learned a bunch, I focused and even tho it wasnt a crazy number of hours studying those hours were efficient. Great review of jenkins, it is totally necessary.<hr>
<h3>16/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Jenkins from nanas, time to crank it up.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did put my time, but got tangled up in some installation and dockerizing stuff, ended up not watching much from the course, but this is good, I feel like untangling shit is one of the core principles of devops therefore all practice is welcomed.
<hr>
<h3>17/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on doing the same, watch nanas when you can but focus on actual hands on stuff. Just put the 10k hours in. It is invalueable.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I spent the day with my daughter, its near the end of the year and I think it's hitting me a bit, I feel the feels... So I didnt do much, Ill make it up during the week(hopefully).
<hr>
<h3>18/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
work on some projects with docker and jenkins, then watch a bit more of nanas course
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
BREAKING NEWS, another unexpected obstacle, a big ass remodeling in the apartament directly underneath us, this whole week will be used for removing the whole apartaments floor, so I just cant tank the noise, it is prettu loud. I went to my moms and there it was a whole another shit... fact is I did not study at all... again.
<hr>
<h3>19/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Well, now im almost a week late in my half month schedule, so I will still try to actually do my jenkins review with nanas course
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Still going through the reform downstairs, so I couldnt stay home, but I did get some study during early hours, finished jenkins stuff. Now Ill be going for a different review or even a project.
<hr>
<h3>20/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
t was supposed to be k8s, but I went for docker, I still need better fundamentals with docker to really get going with k8s
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did spent a decent ammount of time on docker but I got stuck in a few bugs with node + docker, I found out that apparently node shuts down its container because of a bug within pid1 in linux, must investigate further.
<hr>
<h3>21/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Docker, no guilt trip. Helsinki University docker course (on my own time)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I guess that being a lil easier on myself paid dividends, got a lot of knowledge and even some new stuff about docker, this course is really great and I am enjoying, I really think the best type of course is well ellaborated and up to date writte text book style lessons.
<hr>
<h3>22/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
More docker. Helsinki University (docker basics)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Today was a good day, got some quality time and streamed everythong, I also did the last optional exercise, and otmorrow ill be working on the mandatory ones which are supposed to be more challenging
<hr>
<h3>23/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
More docker. Helsinki University (mandatory exercises)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did not put any time in it today, I had to think about it to understand what happened, I just wasted lots of time on trying to make the stream work, so I really should take that into account frmo now on.
<hr>
<h3>24/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I must finish the exercises from Docker Helsinkis university.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Success, I finished the first mandatory question, fully understood everything involved in it as well. GOod sessions and I am happy with the results.
<hr>
<h3>25/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Spend the day mostly with family, although get a couple of hours in if you can, show some extra focus and consistency could make wonders for my self confidence.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Surprisingly enough I got some juice out of the end of the day, quite tired and half assing but I did some studying and ended up finishing a exercise. Now I only one more so we can go for the next docker section.
<hr>
<h3>26/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
More docker, helsinkis university!
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished the first part, fianlly, kinda got stuff on the last exercise but finally finished it. I got 2 good sessions in the day and I do feel like I upgrade my docker skills specially creating images which can be quite complicated.
<hr>
<h3>27/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Start the second part of the hellsinki university.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Great study session, did get a lot of learning in and also took some more direct beginner steps towards finding a job. Lots opf hours and good pick uo form an atypical low hours daily ration month. December has been slow in the actual study end, but I am already about to complete 4 months and still very motivated and feeling like I will be ready to get started on studying for certifications.
<hr>
<h3>28/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on doing the docker helsinkis course, best case scenario get to at least the last section of the second part (docker compose / network)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Mission accomplished (kinda), I did get to the last exercises but I did zero progress in them, I also got very little studying time. I also went surfing with no swell, I should not, specially after a good swell over the weekend.
<hr>
<h3>29/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep working on docker helsinki, but remember I can mix things up whenever I get too stuck on something (be from borendom or inability to do some exercise)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I invested a lot of hours, but with very little progress, these exercises are no joke, it took me half the day to solve one. I do feel like I am gettin close to real experience tho, just learning about it docker was not really cutting it.
<hr>
<h3>30/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Helsinki docker, today I MUST finish the second part, no excuses.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Few hours in but not much progress, still stuck in the 2.9 exercise. The reality is that I did not focus as much as I could and should.
<hr>
<h3>31/12/2023</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Try and get at least one exercise finished. Thats all I can ask for right now, the very last day of the year.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I was able to get some lil bit of study, but not very efficient to be honest, this whole month of december was a bit weak, but 2024 will be the year ill become at least good at devops.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>January 2024</h2>

<h3>01/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I will take the first day of the year ot reassess and organize, plan a bit of the year and a little more detailed plan for january and even more details for this week.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Not enough hours, but I did get some of my planning drawn, I decided to dedicate 2024 to my professional life, that is the main focus but I will also have to sidehustle with uber, it is decided, and my family will have to take the impact of my absence, but I must remind myself of the endgoal here and also not forget who I am doing this for.
<hr>
<h3>02/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Some complementary planning for the week schedule and hands on devops reviews with AWS reassembly.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Almost the whole day spent on just docker really, I love docker and I think it's important to get good at it, its almost like one of those base techs that serves as building step for a lot more advanced stuff. Its clearly very powerfull by itself but being good at it for surte it will help me a lot undesratanding more complex tools and techs.
<hr>
<h3>03/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
AWS (studying root53 right now with stephane) and some other complementary tech (could be kubernetes)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Most of the day was on aws but the aws study was compromised by my anxiety since I actually got a job interview, so that made it difficult to focus on aws studies, I also spent some time preparing for the interview but I could still get a bit of aws in.
<hr>
<h3>04/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
AWS (well architect and strat on s3 ) / the secondary task is for job interview and hunt
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Good day, got a lot of time studying no top of a half decent interview (lots of practice needed here), I am working on some skillbuilder stuff just to warm um my way backj into aws stuff, me like it!
<hr>
<h3>05/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Work on the game development with AWS badge / extra time can be used for linkeding networking
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
This is an awesome day, got a ton of content in, and really re sparckle my aws love, actually now I feel like I can not only understand everything wayyyy easier, I also am able to apreciate the actual good and innovation aws and cloud tech offer the industry, its just marvelous.
<hr>
<h3>06/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
10 am kuberenet with linux tips / AWS during the rest of the day
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Well, the week was going great and today I messed up, and yeah, it was 100% my fault, I know I cant play games for only a couple of hours... so I basically spent my whole 'computer' time playing a silly game... I did watch the k8s class, but I really didnt learn jack.
<hr>
<h3>07/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish game development with AWS badge
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I could finish the section but I just didnt feel like I could do the test, just didnt learn deep enough the content. From now on I will jsut focus on my test really.
<hr>
<h3>08/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 12 to 15 (2h 40m). This whole week will be a crazy netflix marreks videos week, focus on just watching the whole content, do not need to reaserch anything.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
 Done, every single section done with only half the available time dedicated to it, I kind watched everything real quick, now the focus is to cover the whole content quickly so I can get to the test and then be able to review my weakest subjects and study particular questions taht I felt like I had to.
<hr>
<h3>09/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 16 to 18 (3h 14m).
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Another objetcive completed. What makes the day special is that I actually got my secondary quest done as well, finished the security intro course from fortinet, its very basic but its a good introduction to cyber security and it offers a free certification (still need to finish 2 more courses to get the cert, I guess ill be doing a module a week as secoindary quests for the week. The main quest of course is AWS SSA certi)
<hr>
<h3>10/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 19 to 23 (3h 16m). This is a very challenging day, long hours of these sections on a surf day.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Done, it was well enough, lot of concepts and lots of tools, mostly I had heard of it before but some new info about each of them, def will need a review on some, specially the data analysis areas wich are kind of a foreign concept to me, def my weakest aspect are related stuff to big data and data bases. Overall a good day Id say.
<hr>
<h3>11/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 24 to 26 (3h 36m).
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
fail today, I just couldnt take in any longer, my sleeping schedule is making so much more difficult to understand the concepts... surfing also made me very tired and maybe maybe maybe that may help me take control of my sleeping schedule. So right now I am late on the course, today I may even take a quikc surfing trip, that might leave me even further behind... gotta pay attention to that... just take it back man. tomorrow is a day off... so I really got to do this.. just do my best!!
<hr>
<h3>12/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 27 to 28 (3h 19m).
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I just couldnt finish it, very tired for 2 reasons, lack of sleep and too much surfing (there is an epic swell right now at my spot, I cant miss it, as long as I do my work stuff tho). So I couldnt finish what I had to do unfortunatelly, I did most of it but not all of it, now I will have to work in my day off, which would it tomorrow. no bueno.
<hr>
<h3>13/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
day off // no more day off, now I will try to get my side quest done (k8s study for class tomorrow morning) and a few more lecture from maareks ssa course, so that way there is time left sunday for a practice test (only with this result I can organize nexts week study schedule)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
super special day, dont even care that I didnt study hahahaha, i wont leave mention in this diary why today is special, but I didnt study at all (i watched the k8s class but very lightly )I spent the day with my family
<hr>
<h3>14/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Sections 29 to 33 (1h 43m).
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Done! finito! amzing work if i say so myself! Well, finish as well the test so now I can focus nexts week studys, so good man, I am def pumped. (although the result of this practice test was a 57)
<hr>
<h3>15/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
( 13 questions goal ) Plan the whole week out and get hands dirty immediatly // mid day update: after accessing the results of the practice test, i decided to review every single question (correct and incorrect ones) and on top of reading the tests feedback I will be doing some extended research, just letting my curiosity guide a little bit here, so I will be doing at least 13 questions a day, so I can be done AT MOST by friday.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Well, I studied and review a few first questions, I went a bit too deep in some of the subjects and may have wasted too much time, but then I had an unexpected thing to get done and had to drop the studyings way earlier. I WILL have to make up for this time or wont be able to accomplish my goals, finally I only completed 8 out of minimum of 13 I should finish.
<hr>
<h3>16/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
( 26 questions goal ) Go hard on my questions review. thats it!
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did it, congrats to me, 30 questions reviewed out of the 26 I should have, mission accomplished even better than thought it would. Many hours of study all based on the test questions, got actually quite a few questions ahead of schedule. I feel good.
<hr>
<h3>17/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
( 39 questions goal ) Keep it moving, do not lose focus now that we are ahead of schedule, goal for the day is 39 questions revised at the very least! I am enjoying reviewing questions a lot, it's a very good mix of subjects which it helps me avoiding boredom.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished them all, i actually got to 49 questions. A bit tired but this is the game, get to it till I cant fuckin learn, this is a brain gym right there! Keep it up mfkr!! I can feel I understanding everything better, there is still a long way to go tho.
<hr>
<h3>18/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
( 52 questions goal ) The object is almost reached already, so I might actually work a bit on another test (not planned), or just work a secondary quest.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Very good job, a bit rushy by the final 10 questions or so, but I did finish them all and already did another test... decent result, better grade than the last one, got it up to 61%, great news. So now I can move to some of secondary quests before going for reviewing question ( one thing tho, I am thinking of dropping the k8s course saturday mnorning, I just cant keep up with it right now, must focus on aws theory and projects with aws) 
<hr>
<h3>19/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>( 65 questions ) - already finish all questions! Then I can spend half the day on projects and a half on aws (correction of the practice exam)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Well I tried to work a project but I decided to actually do a very simple architecture with aws using terraform, it is just something I cant not avoid, the project might be simple but using IAC is necessary. I did some of the work and could study some aws as well.
<hr>
<h3>20/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
AWS, I might actually focus on skillbuilder for a bit (instead of working with maarek)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I had to do the k8s course, that messed me up cause IM not really paying attention to it and at the same time couldnt do well the aws study, also it was not for a long time, but it was quality study although a bit too narrow (only IAM policies subject)
<hr>
<h3>21/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<b>ANNOUNCMENT ----> DAY FOR THE TEST IS DECIDED 29/02/24</b><br>
to be able to do it tho I must have scored at leasa 90 in the second round of maareks practice exams and passed on most of dojos exams
also, new suggestions for a study strategy for these last 30 days, I should alocate some daily time for at very least go over at least 1h a day for maareks videos, this time could expand to 2 hour MAX, and then the time left in the day for study should be around the same subjects, just focus a single day on a small area.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finish the IAM deep dive and start on working at correcting and reviewing subjects from the last practice exame I've done.
<hr>
<h3>22/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Completelly forgot todays task, godamn it // I remember later, every monday I am supposed to take a mock test.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did take the practice exam (got a 72%), also organized a lot of stuff and planned the path to certification.
<hr>
<h3>23/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Review questions from mondays test, then read a bit on the subjects i feel weaker.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Lot of struggling, I did get through most of the questions reviewing but not as much focus as I think I can put on, Im gettin a bit tired, but cannot lose it now, I am doing well, jsut keep it up!!!
<hr>
<h3>24/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Review of the incorrect answers, 15 minutes on each subject.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I am so tired, also surfed a bit too much, i really need to limit the ammount of consecutive hours of surf cause it kills me for the rest of the day. Result is that I couldnt even finish what I was supposed to do today, very few hours of study and with very low quality. thats ok tho, its not linear, forgive myself and lets do better tomorrow. (do not try to make up for it, its a new day)
<hr>
<h3>25/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Exam Practice @ 14:00 (maareks exam 5)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did the test, did not pass but got somewhere acceptable 64%. I could study a bit early in the morning, it was a good day even though I failed the mock exam.
<hr>
<h3>26/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Review all questions 5 minutes on each subject (take notes on subjects thatt need further investigation).
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I could put some hours of full focus, got done half of the questions but just couldnt do them all, the day had few surprises that were enough for me... although it is my own fault really, lack of resilience to adversities.
<hr>
<h3>27/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish the questions reviews, there is NO way to skip completing this task, this is an ultimatum.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Done! Efficient and welldone! After that I went over some cyber security stuff but I notice fortinet course is too vendor-locked, so I went for ciscos but I thought it was too basic. So I just study javascript/logic from aluras/boticario course. Excellent teacher and the whole thing is in portuguesse, he is good and I should finish it tomorrow (its supposed to be a week long) I need to finish it quickly and sweetly, the focus will still be aws saa.
<hr>
<h3>28/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Complete the AWS skillbuilder test, do one or 2 tutorials from cantrill and finish the day with some logic/js from alura, make sure to allocate some time for organizing next week.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Completed: one cantrill's tutorial, and aluras JS course // incomplete: AWS skillbuilder test, organize week. I coulda finished, but I went surfing like a moron...
<hr>
<h3>29/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Organize week, take a test, finish aluras JS course, attend the boticarios devops class.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Success! All tasks accomplished, this is the power of scheduling. I wish I did more of that... got a 69% on the test, kinda did it half baked, I am a bit tired of taking tests tho, maybe I should take a break from this heavy test taking routine
<hr>
<h3>30/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Go over the test, do one tutorial (cantrils mini projects), work a bit on devops trilha.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I focused on extending research on the questions I got wrong and worked a bit on the devops alura course. It's actually a change of pace, I was reading over real fast the questions after I finished the test, I changed my mind on that, I dont think its a good strategy, I may be better off by taking fewer tests and going deeper into the correction by actually doing some deeper reading and rewatching some videos.
ecution ---> 
<hr>
<h3>31/01/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Do aws questions review and a some trilha devops GB
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Difficult day really, tired af and not very willing to put the work in, lots of things happened as well to make it even more difficult.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>February 2024</h2>
<h3>01/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Do half the git course (devops alura), do a good aws mini project and go over at least 10 questions review
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I bit unmotivated, kinda of sick of AWS and starting to question whhy I really want aws cert, I know it will draw some HR traffic but I wont be able to be useful right now, at the same time I have 2 new oportunities for devops paths that if I take either one of them I will for sure be employed till the end of the year, Im afraid the aws cert is more a badge of honor... maybe even a ego trip in all honesty, the better alternative is clear, need to work first then certs to improve my career...
<hr>
<h3>02/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I will need to organize a new schedule, splitting my time more evenly, I want to keep on studyng aws but way less intense...
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Got the new "schedule" in the back of my mind, nothing too documented for now, but I will be for sure splitting my time and taking aws certifying a tiny slower. After the ideas I just study a bit of Java in the morning and did nothing more the rest of the day, it was a real short day and I should make up for it tomorrow.
<hr>
<h3>03/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
No plans were made, this is a late update.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Even though there were no plans it was a great day, lots of knowledge and with plenty of variety, did very good progress with Java, then finished a git course and got good practice, then put some time into aws. great day.
<hr>
<h3>04/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
No plans were made, this is a late update.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Decent day, good work for a Sunday. A very nice aws/devops project with tutorial done.
<hr
><h3>05/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Evolving and improving the aws devops project (Imrans)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished the refactoring of imrans project with aws, this time using mostly aws managed tools. Still trying to figure how to put that in my portfolio.
<hr>
<h3>06/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
No plans were made, this is a late update.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I really got cock blocked by myself, I tried very hard to evolve but during the morning I was very stuck, I did some thinking and random reading but it just didnt feel like any progress was made, that way during the afternoon I just lost focus completelly, most of the time I watched pipeline WSL while I did some backend node js study during the breaks... late in the night i did some password cycling and spent a lot of time on that.
<hr>
<h3>07/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I wrote a few objectives for the rest of the week, starting with finish IT_talents Java today.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
The day started bad hehehe, the IT_talent plataform is real slow right now, so I just changed to alura python. Completed the python very well, loved it. Then I struggle throughout the Java course, god this is just a nightmare, I could def enjoy learning Java but this platform is just horrible.
<hr>
<h3>08/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Do the documentation project aws, MANDATORY. The day might be a bit short tho, Ill have many obligations off pc.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
The day was not short, I am really focused right now, really on a streak, it seems like when I have a bit of structure my stuff just flows better, thats a challenge for getting projects done since I have no structure to do them for now... I will have to research for that. The rest of the day I spent a lot of time researching multiple different techs trying to make sense of the big picture. Some hours were also dedicated to Java.
<hr>
<h3>09/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on project again, I think picking a more specific project like my cloud resume challenge may be the best way for me to get this going. Also I want to do some Java course.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Talking about reality check.... I thought it was a simple project but it seems that it is a notoriously hard test... So it will take way longer than I expected, which is not bad. let´s gooooo
<hr>
<h3>10/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Cloud resume challenge.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I just didnt do it, actualy I did nothing, took a day off. Not sure why, it was not planned, I just did not feel like doing anything, it is the first day of carnaval but I do not celebrate at all, so it was not the reason why I slacked off, I feel tired and I am ahead of the schedule tho.
<hr>
<h3>11/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I dId not plan anything, this is a late planning. Lets study cloudfront, I need it
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did put a few hours in, actually the very few 5 last hours of the day, it was not very productive, but I did it, I had to fight a very big lack of motivation, and not to tap myself on the back but this might be a better sign than the actual knowledge aquired, the real benefit of the day it mightve been the fact I fought my inner bitch, I conquered it! On to the next week. (The fact that I had already finished my time goal for the week made that bithc sooooo strong, I just didnt feel like giving the extra blood to it. Fuckin did it man, lets gooooo!!! This is a breath of fresh air no doubt.)
<hr>
<h3>12/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I have the week goals in the exalidraw file, so it depends, but most likely finish the JAVA course frmo IT talents.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Well, I did start the day welll, and went for the studies from early (evne before waking my kid up), I study for a bit and then a friend made me go surfing hehehe... Came back, had lunch, took a nap, woke up and then put good work in. Put the hours I had to. But I did finish the fourth Java module, then got excited and did the 5th too... while im wrinting this Im doing the last one, which it seems to be the coolest one by far (it is also the last one).
<hr>
<h3>13/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish IT talent, the last part Java play / SBT / API
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished the Java course, at the very very end I weakened a bit but I have been actually finishing stronger and stronger my courses (finishing its always been a weak point in my trajectory), thinking back I actually came from not being able to finish most of my courses to be able to finish them barely to now almost finish at full strength, the goal is to be able to finish it as strongly as I started it. After that I got a lot of python in my, at this point it's on like donkey kong, I can not allow myself to not write python code everyday, this will be def the devops language (ill still learn/practice other ones, but python must be given special care).
<hr>
<h3>14/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on pythoning till the end of the module 4 Alura. Then maybe I should take a look a bit at some django, because I will need to understand how to write and API and connect to a database(RDS pref) for the resume challenge.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Finished the course, success on that.
<hr>
<h3>15/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Write me some python code, now it is time to maintain python on my toolbox. From now on I should keep it as a daily practice (at least 1 hour of it), let's get some initial projects.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Did some free ranging on python, to get to know the landscape a lil bit, after that I notice my total lack of knowledge of databases, so I study a bit of SQL pure, the completed half of a course on python+mysql.
<hr>
<h3>16/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on studying python with databases, maybe do an actual project with a simple database. (secondary alternative is to watch a bit of alura couses, whcih would be linux focused for now)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Yeah, studying python, trying to progress into the language, I tried checking automation stuff but I did some work also with databases and APIs. Decent work.
<hr>
<h3>17/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
This weekend at least I will focus on python specifically for devops, specially from the youtube channel from the authors of (( python for devops: learn ruthlessly effective automation )) starting with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbCBe7hlLbk
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I felt like I need a bit of practice on the language, even before moving into devops/automation, database or other frameworks(django, fastapi), so I will be spending a couple of days focused on getting to know the language better, so a small project would be great.
<hr>
<h3>18/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I want to finish a quiz game, very simple game text based, but that way I can understand data structure a lil better.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Done! Good work, this makes me feel so much more confident. I am happy im sharpening my programmnig skills with python, I can see it as possibly being something to make me stand out in the edvops world, I am going into a sort of unrelated area (im kind studying pygame now), but that is making me soooo interested that I think it is worth being less devopsy focused. I finished aluras pythons modules and felt like now it would be a good time to pick it up and make it stick for real.

<hr>
<h3>19/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Just have fun with python, let it sink in for the whole week, just make sure to deepen my knowledge of python while also makins sure to understand some key areas (database integrations, automation of devopsy tasks, one or two framworks)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I went through half way a greate pygame tutorial then spent almost as much time doing codewars for python, even though the codewar is more for logic I could use it to make me go through docs so I can find better ways to write code, those 2 "unfocused" practice styles (pygame and codewars), have been very beneficial to keep me curious to explore the language. I am really enjoying working with python, for real.
<hr>
<h3>20/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep it working with python and pygame, finish the pygame basic tutorial and do at least a snake game with it.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did not finish it nor did the snake game, Ill give myself one more day for this then I must focus on server side stuff and specific devopsy python skills. Maybe one day for a brief intro into frameworks (flask or django)
<hr>
<h3>21/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
My bday, normal day, focus! Last day of pygame and generic python studies, after this I have to get on the mandatory part of python for devops.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
Got good sessions, I couldn't reach my goal for ammount of hours but I did get some focused work and finished the tutorial on pygame I was planning to. Thats a big win, happy bday me. Now that I got a decent grasp on the language, I should focus on devopsy stuff but first I will get my hands first on API and backend stuff with python, I will dedicate the whole day to that (2 days tops!! I will need at least the next 2 days of the week for devopsy stuff, this will be an on going activity for my career ). A good tutorial and then a tiny small practice project
<hr>
<h3>22/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on python backend.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I studied pure python, core intermediary topics, like classes and a few more subjects. Well, reality checks are very common in a self taught student's life, we just dont really know how extensive a subjects really is till we are actually deep into it, and this is another case, the old russian doll, sometimes we try to understand a subject and we find inside a few more subjects necessary for that one to be understood, this is normal and must be seen not as a failure but as a test of resilience and wisdom, do not rush things, we have to respect the process, it aind easy.
<hr>
<h3>23/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Keep on going with python, lets try and finish one small project with automation (desktop cleaner)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
So muhc stuff to learn just to be good at python... It really is endless, I will def need to focus a bit more and extend my python practice to well over this week, its something I will just have to practice almost daily. Could not finish the small automation project but studied for many hours about classes and special modules for the project.
<hr>
<h3>24/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Finish the automation project, just the downloads organizer.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I did finish it, although I post it in my groups boticarios class and just one person liked it, I guess it wasn't that impressive ehhee. I loved it tho and it is done! So success!! The rest of the day I went for some other broad understanding to make the migration to understand django.
<hr>
<h3>25/02/2024</h2>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on a brief intro to Django or anything to support my uderstand of it. (Tomorrow), try to follow a small app tuotorial with django
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
I completed a quick introduction to Django and found it extremely useful. Over the past two weeks, I've made significant strides in Python. Not only has this improved my skillset, but it has also boosted my confidence. With a solid foundation in Python, I feel prepared to stand out among my peers. I recall one of my boot camp mentors mentioning the extensive use of Python in their DevOps department, which could potentially enhance my employment prospects.<br><br>
However, that was just an introduction, and I now need to practice Python regularly, ideally daily. I'm proud to say that I achieved my goal of 60 hours of practice per week throughout February. I learned a lot and feel incredibly productive.<br>
I've also been reading about Lambda, RDS/Dynamo in preparation for the resume challenge. I aim to make progress on this in the coming weeks, which should be feasible as my boot camp will be focusing on Linux. I'm already ahead in this area, but still plan to take the Alura courses.<br>
As I approach the six-month mark of studying DevOps (I started on 27/08/23), I need to plan the next few weeks carefully to maintain my pace of progress.
<hr>
<h3>26/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Planning</u></h4>
Plan the month a little bit and more specifically the next couple of weeks. The actual plan for the day depend on it (i do have an idea already tho, so I might do it quickly)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I did not follow the plan to plan, I went of rails fast. I started the day by just watching a few minutes of boticarios alura linux module and ennded up doing all the 4 linux modules... (equivalent to 2 weeks of course), the second half of the 4th module was not very well absorbed, I might actually jump back into it and redo it.</p><p> I really did go into a netflix mode here, but in all honesty I knew most of it so I could just glance over. But I still need to do the planning for the month.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>27/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
I got to do the planning and there is also a jobinterview today, good luck to me.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>This marked my second real DevOps job interview. I can confidently say that the day of a job interview makes me very nervous. It's challenging to maintain the presence of mind required to stick to my study plan. After the interview, while I feel quite motivated, I also lack focus. This is definitely something I need to improve. I can't afford to waste an entire day due to a one-hour interview, especially because job interviews currently feel more like practice, rather than concrete job opportunities.
</p><br>
<p>The rest of the day, I spent organizing this journal. It still needs some work, but it's already quite lengthy, making it very time-consuming to organize it entirely</p>
<p>However, there was a silver lining. By the later hours of the day, I managed to figure out the route53 DNS for the resume challenge. I'm also nearly perfecting my sleep schedule. It's still a bit off, but I'm hopeful that in the next few days it should be on point.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>28/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4> 
<b>This is a small quick plan for the next couple of weeks.</b><br><br>
This week, my priority is completing the Python+Dynamo backend for the resume challenge. While focusing on that, I will also devote time to Linux, as this week and next are dedicated to it. <br><br>

My approach will be to: <br>

<ul>
<li>Practice relentlessly 
<li>Concentrate on understanding networking 
<li>Intentionally breaking things and attempting to fix them.
<li>AI exercises.
<li>Undertaking Under the Wire challenges.
<li>Some automation scripting(refresh memory bash scripting). 
<li>Revisit module 4 on disk partitioning from Alura's Linux course.
</ul>
<p>I plan to spend most of the day on the resume challenge. However, I'll also reserve at least a couple of hours for Linux activities.

<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>While the execution wasn't ideal, I recognize there's room for improvement. I found myself delving into the intricacies of web architecture and absorbing high-level videos on software architecture and legacy structure. My study also included a mix of reading and watching videos about Oracle WebLogic, which appeared to be significant for the role I interviewed for yesterday. Although the experience was decent, being a newcomer to the subject made it challenging to identify valuable resources.</p>
<p>Later, I attempted to complete Linux sysadmin exercises with ChatGPT. Although I chose the right method, I didn't dedicate sufficient time to it. I plan on rectifying this tomorrow.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>29/02/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4> Total focus on linux. (network and admin)
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>The late-night session was excellent, providing ample practice and reading on Linux. Although it wasn't very lengthy, it was productive. I went surfing afterwards and was quite tired, so I relaxed for the remainder of the morning before sleeping into the afternoon. 
<p>I intended to make up for the lost time later, but a car issue that my wife encountered required my attention, causing me to miss the night session.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h2>March 2024</h2>
<h3>01/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>The rest of this week and next week are already set on Linux studies.
<p>Lets do some projects but most of my attention should be on boticarios/alura boot camp, take what alura offers and double down with my own research and handson, dig deeper into every subject alura covers. 
<p>Try and get some practice on each subject them as well, with chatgpt that gets super easy to do. 
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I spent the whole day on the book <font size="+1"><b>The Linux DevOps Handbook</b></font> (400 pg), got through the first quarter of the book, mostly content I already have decent understanding, so much of it I went through very quickkly but I could still learn a few good new tidbids and got some very good practice (specially on bash script), it was just the perfect review for linux on good timing as well (coincidently i might need it for a technical interview I may have)
<b>Covered book sections</b>
<ul>
    <li>Part 1: Linux Basics</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Chapter 1: Choosing the Right Linux Distribution</li>

</ul>
<br><hr>
<h3>02/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>Very similar day to yesterday, focus on the <font size="+1"><b>The Linux DevOps Handbook</b></font>, the goal is to do if I get tired of it I could switch to another linux related method, <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/"> WarGames</a> is a great and fun option.

<p><b>Goal for the day: Book sections</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Chapter 5: Managing Services in Linux</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Technical requirements</li>

        <li>Summary</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>That was a long day, first couple hours for organization of my repos (it is important for recruiters be able to find my stuff), then I went deep into processes, services and thread in linux, following the book, but then.... then it came linux networking, and that got me stuck.</p>
<p>The book goes over the commands for network, and I know them, but i want to understand in depth, like what is an interface and/or what/how we create an actual network with vm machines. I had to go on youtube to look for that information, but then I rememeber that aluras next step on my trail is 4 big network courses, so I went ahead to start doing them.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a very good day, long but profitable (in terms of knowledge). I was a bit reluctuntly cause I really want to still focus on linux for the next week, but I am starting to think it will have to be at the very least hibrid.</p>
<p>I even played with docker a little bit, in the devops world, all of that is connected; serves, linux network, processes, services, vms, protocols, containers... I guess I will have to mix them up to better understand. </p> 
<br><hr>
<h3>03/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I already reached my goal for the week, but I could use today for more "watching" content instead of going heavy on hands on. It's just a lot more relaxing.</p>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>The entire day was dedicated to re-writing my resume (it was so bad that I can barely call it a re-do, feels more like I am creating it for the first time). I got 2 interviews with only 10 really bad resumes sent, so I figured that I improve my chances with a brand new one explaining a little more about my story.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>04/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I want to focus on some <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/"> WarGames</a> challenges (but I should not spend the whole day just doing that), the secondary goal would be work a little more on network with linux or the aluras network course.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I did a bunch of the wargame chalenges, I was doing very well, and it was all fun and games till I reached a HARD plateu, <b>Network</b>.</p>
When I got to challenges with networking I got totally stuck, it is currently the largest gap in my knowledge, and a very important one. The next couple of weeks will be very important, I will dedicate them entirely to understand networks, I must have total conceptual understand of it, and some handson would help on better understanding. </p>
<p>I believe to work with containers (the very ground for devops) I must understand completelly networks AND linux, those 2 techies are basically what makes a container possible and able to communicate between them and to anything else in the world. So no rush here, I really do need to learn well these concepts.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>05/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
More work on linux and a bit of network if I feel like it (and I do). I could start to think a bit about picking back up the resume challenge (next few days). 
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I put the time in, I wish I could say that was enough, but it ain't. After many hours of networking and less linux (against my planning), I came to a few realizations.</p>
<p>I read it through the content and watched yt videos, but networking is still a mistery for me, I just cant find the right material. Whenever I think I understand an individual concept I just can't really put it in context of a bigger picture and  connect the dots so I can use it pratically. </p>
<p>I guess I will really need a more structured and longer course on the subject, one with hadns on would be very helpfull, specially if i it was more related to what I have been doing, something teaching network from a linux and VMs from vmbox point of view, but I prob wont find it, my best shot is to look for a more traditional course with phisical tooling and structuring.</p> 
<br><hr>
<h3>06/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I need to build a network in linux. A VERY basic one, just so I can get ahold of the basics.</p>
<p>During the day I found a good goal for today, work on cisco network tutorials, the goals is to finish the first few chapters and finish do the Checkpoint exam, build a small network.</p>

<a href='https://skillsforall.com/'>Network basics</a>
<h3>Cisco Networking Basics</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Course Introduction</li>
    <li>Module 1: Communication in a Connected World</li>
    <li>Module 2: Network Components, Types, and Connections</li>
    <li>Module 3: Wireless and Mobile Networks</li>
    <li>Module 4: Build a Home Network</li>
    <li>Checkpoint Exam: Build a Small Network</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I am happy with my performance, I studied hard and focused very much, I messed up slightly and missed my mark for ammount of hours a day, but the ones I did get in were high quality ones, I feel like I did do some progress with networking.</p>
<p>I also couldn't finish the last task, I mightve been able to if I knew the software required for the tas, <b>Cisco Packet Tracer</b>, so I had to learn it, I am taking ciscos course for it, so I had to interrupt the Network course to do the Packet Tracer.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>07/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I will finish the <b>Cisco Packet Tracer course</b> (not sure if I will need more than one, I know there are several ones) and then I will get back to work on the Cisco Network introduction.</p>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>Lots and lots of hours reading and watching videos, finished all my objectives for the day and went way past them, took a lot more classes from cisco, but then I changed thing up again.</p>
<p>I decided that I will go back to aluras courses because they opened their platform for a month, so now I have ton of new courses available, so I'll try to take advantage of that.</p>
<br><hr>
<h3>08/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>Total focus on network courses from Alura!</p>
<p>Objectives for the day:</p>
<p>Finish the course --> Redes: dos conceitos iniciais à criação de uma intranet</li>
<p>Start the course -->  Redes: construindo um projeto com VLANs, políticas de acesso e conexão com internet (at least 50% of it)</p>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>I finished the Aluras Network I, and started working on redes II, then I swung back to ciscos network course so I can strengthen my basic knowledge and take a break from aluras redes II, which I did started but I felt a steep curve from I's.
<p>It was a decent day but I felt like too redudant, so I def need to hurry the fuck up on Ciscos or go ahead and swallow the korean-hard-mode from aluras and man it up. 
<br><hr>
<h3>09/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I'd like to finish ciscos network course over the weekend. It shouldn't take too long. it is def doable but still challenging but not "over 10 hours each day challenging".
<ul>
    <li>Module 12: Gateways to Other Networks</li>
    <li>Module 13: The ARP Process</li>
    <li>Module 14: Routing Between Networks</li>
    <li>Checkpoint Exam: Communication Between Networks</li>
    <li>Module 15: TCP and UDP</li>
    <li>Module 16: Application Layer Services</li>
    <li>Module 17: Network Testing Utilities</li>
    <li>Checkpoint Exam: Protocols for Specific Tasks</li>
    <li>Networking Basics Course Final Exam</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p> I already put the minimum ammount(44h) but I am still a few hours short from the actual gold-goal of 60h a week.
<p> Not much progress to be honest, I took a semi-break, I should make up for it tomorrow I prob wont, I should at least put a few more hours tho. The thing is that there are many nbrand new concepts that need time to sink in, I sure can understand them when wathcing someone explaining, but they get real fog real quick after a few hours, they need to be studied, exercised and remembered. Otherwise I am just being kidnappend by my curiosity</p>
<p>The thing is, networking for me is really brand new, I have been learning it the past 6 months by bits and pieces from AWS services but they are all aws managed and that hid from me so most of what was going on underneath... So networking was always a thing I felt I would just not learn and let the cloud take care of it,in the back of my mind I knew one day I would have to take a step back and actually leaern networking from a more professional manner.
<p>At least for aone more week I should dedicate most of my time to study it as deeply as I can, that is way I am taking the Cisco Basic Networkign course cuncurrently, it's the basics, and that is exactly what I need atm.
<br><hr>
<h3>10/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
Focus on basics, lets get some Ciscos Network basics progress.
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>Not much progress... I did take a lazy weekend, another big reason in all honesty is that there is a swell and I am surfing too much, it makes me so exhausted that I have no stamina left to sit down and study.</p>
<p>Let's cut down on the surfing next week, main goal is to finish Ciscos course and then Redes II from alura.
<p>
<br><hr>
<h3>11/03/2024</h3>
<h4><u>Plan</u></h4>
<p>I am typing this plan at 15:00 on monday, so I already messed up the first part of the day, now it's time to get motherfucking serious godamnit!!!!</p>
<p>Do not play boy, get real!</p>
<p>Finish Cisco course and Alura's Redes II, also do a little bit of the security cisco's courses</p>
<h4><u>Execution</u></h4>
<p>Finished cisco's course, it was very very educational, I really feel a completelly different understanding of networking, I may take a quick break of networking tho, I need the time to let the knowledge sink in.</p>
<p>I also attended the first class for the <font size=+1><b>IT Talent devops course</b></font>. I liked it very much, it seems much more job oriented than boticario's bootcamp, also the team felt much more commited, they are clearly way more professional than anything boticario is trying to do. There will be live classes once a week and lots of projects, I think this should be my focus from now on, not confirmed yet, need more confirmation info. 
<br><hr>
