####################### Beginning of the journal #######################
13/10/23 -> Started studying DevOps directly, the goal now is to get a broad idea of the enviroment and how I will aproach this first basic contact.

15/10/23 -> Started a new course, more focused on DevOps (53h Imran Teli), the biggest reason to change direction was the necessity of acquiring better understanding of the devops basics [I MUST FINISH THIS ONE!!]

17/10/23 -> So many bugs with vagrant (local virtualization), though I begin to feel the first signs of understanding Devops culture and automation.

21/10/23 -> finished the first part of the Devops course, lots of traditional virtualization, linux, bash.

22/10/23 -> Started mixing AWS, replacing on-premise tools and a lot more. Great feeling to be reaching this point to put everything together.

24/10/23 -> 2 days of intense CI/CD studies, it was actually my first formal contact with the concept(heard of it, but never actually put my hand on it), the tool Imran chose is Jenkins ( I am aware there are many other options available ). I am still half way through the CI/CD section and I did face a bit of a learning curve, a few new concepts are being difficult to fully understand, but the little I could grasp was very exciting and motivating.
