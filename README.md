####################### Beginning of the journal 13rd of Octorber 2023 #######################

13/10/23 -> Started studying DevOps directly, the goal now is to get a broad idea of the enviroment and how I will aproach this first basic contact.

15/10/23 -> Started a new course, more focused on DevOps (53h Imran Teli), the biggest reason to change direction was the necessity of acquiring better understanding of the devops basics [I MUST FINISH THIS ONE!!]

17/10/23 -> So many bugs with vagrant (local virtualization), though Im starting to feel the very first signs of understanding Devops culture and automation, quite subtle though.

21/10/23 -> finished the first part of the Devops course, it was about the basis of the workload, lots of traditional virtualization, linux, bash (missed on more networking but I already done a small youtube course on it, 20 or so hours on it).

22/10/23 -> Learning how to include AWS into the mix, replacing on-premise "servers" and even other services with cloud power. Great feeling to be reaching this point to finally make the connection between the cloud and devops practices. (Before this course I was studying only cloud without any real understanding of operations/linux/network)

23/10/23 -> Starting the Jenkins section of the course, it is the longes section of the whole course (6h), Imran does not fuck around, he is a straigh shooter and those 6 hours are of pure content and knowledge, this will be specially a wild ride since I was really looking forward to learn Jenkins cause there is something I like about automation and it looks like Jenkins would be the first actual taste of it.

24/10/23 -> 2 days of intense CI/CD studies, it was actually my first formal contact with the concept(I had heard of it, but never actually had my hands on it), the tool Imran chooses is Jenkins ( I am aware there are many other options available ).
I am still half way through the CI/CD section and I did face a bit of a learning curve in order to get the bigger picture, a few particular new concepts were quite challenging to fully comprehend, but the little I could grasp was very exciting and motivating.

25/10/23 -> Done with first half of the studying section (Jenkins), and with taht finished

26/10/23 -> Due to some burnout from the Jenkins section, I ended up spending the day halfassing, I had the material out but ended up just trying to solve some bugs I had with jenkins+ECS (aws) and a generalized SSH issue. It was basically a day off. no focus and no discipline.

27/10/23 -> Infelizmente comecei o dia colocando umas horas mas logo me abati e procurei reorganizar meu schedule pois Manu esta querendo comecar um trabalho novo.
Horarios bem mais estritos e agora todo dia preciso definir o que vai ser estudado no dia seguinte!

[[28/10/23]]

Objetives:

1. Do a revision of the jenkins section
2. Fix bug that prevented the ECS/jenkins work
3. finish Jenkins section

I could get a lot of study in, but a bit unfocused, it was guided at a high level by the Jenkins material but ended up going everywhere around the subject.

**[[29/10/23]]**

Planning: Finish revision (Docker part specially)
Execution: Done! And even better, could fix the bug with ECS/Jenkins as well!
The revision overall was very beneficial, I went over the jenkins section too quickly and now Im glad I got so many bugs in the section project, that forced me to go back and redo most of the section and I actually expanded the research a lil bit.

**[[30/10/23]]**

Planning: Finish Jenkins section.
Execution: took me a while to go over Jenkins using master and slave concepts, but once I did understand it was very revealing, the power of jenkins is really impressive.
Also there was one very good section on security with Jenkins, many good options but I liked role based permissions for overall utilization.

This ends the Jenkins area, hell of a ride, now I do feel like I got a decent understand of the basics of what it's done in a CI enviroment, prob I will have to learn another tool like github actions, but Jenkins really spoke to me in a way, its ungly, clunky and complicated but so versatile and powerfull, the security of jenkins may be the only deal breaker at this point, it does concern me a bit how we have to leave on the server few hardcoded stuff .

**[[31/10/23]]**<br>
Planning: Research about Ansible, get my feet wet. <br>
Execution: I did some the research but it was quick, and I ended up following the course pre-estabilished order and I will be doing the Python part (I was a bot reclunctant on spending the time on it at this point). Very simple language and alreayd went through half of it.<br><br>

## November

**[[01/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Finish videos from Python section, maybe write some practice code (related to devops/automation) <br>
Execution:

Comments
I ended up finishing the python section but didnt really practice it, it was quite a quick intro to python and I will be seeing it again in the future. So what I really spent my day on was Ansible, boy am I sold on it. I did watch some lectures but I was leaned more on free research, jsut to get an overall grasp of the tool and what it solves.

<br><br>

**[[02/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Go hard at Ansible <br>
Execution: oh boy I did, very much so!

Comments
Followed a lot of video lectures and some decent ammount of documentation reading, not a lot of practice though. I am a bit tired and got a bit ahead of myself, so I guess before finishing the last hour of the ansible section I will take some time off to watch a few "related" videos. I am feeling like following someones project and maybe trying to get a very small project myself would be very beneficial at this point. I am ahead of schedule and do have the available time for it, I just need to make sure this side quest includes Ansible.

<br><br>

**[[03/11/23]]**<br>
Planning: Take it easy and check some related material/projects with ansible <br>
Execution: Wander a lot around the devops world then smashed ansible section.

Comments
A bit of checking devops videos, more related to concepts and culturem this was fun but not really practical, I guess it does help with getting confortable with some tech terms.
Then I tried to watch a few "projects tutorials" but I had a difficult time from the get got, since they all did something with Docker / Terraform within the first 5 minutes. Techs I havent really understood fully.
After feeling like I waste a lot of time I went back to the course and finished the rest of Ansible section, even though it was for only 2 days, I actually took a lot of new concepts even a quick glace (20 mins class) at IaC in the cloud using aws, seems like Terraform is the actual current tool for provisioning infra in the cloud, Ansible is still good tho for configuring all the infra, so I should see a lot of Ansible in my future.
